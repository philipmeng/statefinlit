# 🏫 Assessing State-Mandated Financial Literacy Education in High Schoolers for Long-Term Success  
**By Philip Meng, Phillips Academy Andover**

This project evaluates the impact of state-mandated high school financial literacy education on young adults (ages 18–24) using data from the Federal Reserve’s *Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED)* from 2013 and 2023.

### 🔍 Key Findings
- **Credit Behavior**: In mandate states, the share of young adults making minimum credit card payments rose from 64.7% (2013) to 87.2% (2023).
- **Financial Confidence**: Self-reported financial well-being declined slightly, even as behaviors improved.

### 📌 Conclusion
State mandates improve financial habits but don’t consistently boost confidence—suggesting that practical skills alone are insufficient. The study recommends combining classroom instruction with hands-on tools and emotional support to better empower students for long-term financial resilience.
